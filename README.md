# Cleaning-data-and-the-skies
Background

Your are a data analyst at an environmental company. Your task is to evaluate ozone pollution across various regions. You’ve obtained data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), containing daily ozone measurements at monitoring stations across California. However, like many real-world datasets, it’s far from clean: there are missing values, inconsistent formats, potential duplicates, and outliers. Before you can provide meaningful insights, you must clean and validate the data. Only then can you analyze it to uncover trends, identify high-risk regions, and assess where policy interventions are most urgently needed.

Your challenge

Create a report that covers the following:

Your EDA and data cleaning process.
How does daily maximum 8-hour ozone concentration vary over time and regions?
Are there any areas that consistently show high ozone concentrations? Do different methods report different ozone levels?
Consider if urban activity (weekend vs. weekday) has any affect on ozone levels across different days.
Bonus: plot a geospatial heatmap showing any high ozone concentrations.
